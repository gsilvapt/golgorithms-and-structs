# Golgorithms and Structs

Some notes I took while doing a [Udemy's Computer Science 101 Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-science-101-master-the-theory-behind-programming/)

Some of the algorithsm might not work entirely. The goal was to draft out the logic behind some of the structs and 
algorithms.


Don't take this too seriously.
